<h2>Q&A</h2>
 
<p><b>Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?</b></br>
Yes Crewlink does support Among Us Modifications.</p>
<p><b>Can you get banned for playing on public Servers?</b></br>
At the current state of the game there is no perma ban system for the game. The mod is designed in a way, that it does not send prohibited server requests.
You are also able to join your own custom server to be sure. <a href="https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor">(Impostor)</a></p>
<p><b>How can i join a custom server?</b></br>
Go to your game directory and open BepInEx/config/org.bepinex.plugins.SheriffMod.txt. There you can set the hostname or IP of the server. Then set the server region to CUSTOM.</p>
<p><b>Do my friends need to install the mod to play it together?</b></br>
Yes. Every player in the game lobby has to install it.</p>
